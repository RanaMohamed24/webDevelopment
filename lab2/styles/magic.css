/* 1a- Make the font type "Lucida Calligraphy" for any p or div or span tag */

/* 1b- <h1> tag which is child from div tag to be in the center of the page */
div h1 {
    text-align: center;
}

/* 2- Make inline style for the div with "header" id */
/* This will be done in HTML as inline style:
   style="width:100%; height:60px; background-color:red;" */

/* 3- Make inline style for the span which its id is "linksbar" */
/* This will be done in HTML as inline style:

/* 5c- Make color pink, and background color red for the links that are direct child for <li> tag, which inside span with id= "linksbar", when mouse is over it */
#linksbar li > a:hover {
    color: pink;
    background-color: red;
}

/* 5d- Make the font weight bold, and font size 12px, for the paragraph that comes directly after (sibling) <h2> tag which is direct child for <span> with id="content" */

/* 5f- Make style that makes the background color yellow of the any <input> of type "text" */

/* 6- Make an internal style that makes font color red for the <p> with id "aboutus" */
/* This will be done in HTML as internal style in <style> tag:
   #aboutus { color: red; } */

/* 6- another internal style that makes the color yellow for the <p> with id "aboutus" that's direct child from span with id "content" */
/* This will be done in HTML as internal style in <style> tag:
   #content > #aboutus { color: yellow; } */
/* Answer: The second style will be applied (yellow color) because it has higher specificity (two IDs vs one ID) */

/* 7- Use !important with the first style of the previous 2 styles */
/* If we add !important to the first style: #aboutus { color: red !important; }
   Then red color will be applied because !important overrides specificity rules */
